-use "الرسول" (not preceded by a ibn, abd, abou) or "صلعم" as stop words refering to end of sanad
-reduce words that mean "قال"
-maybe use numbers or punctuations
	given 2 names without a narrator connector and with a punctuation mark, consider them as 2 different narators
	if we get a punctuation mark in the context of a tolerance state, we break tolerance
	use the numbers with reservation, if they happen at the beginning of a paragraph to segment hadith
