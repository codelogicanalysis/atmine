done partially---use runtime options instead of compile options
done---use stem comparison for NRC
done---Differentiate between name of person and name of place for the hadith...and nisba for person and place
done---Detect days 
done---عمّن as عن
done--in case  we have two عن, and later we have continued list of narrators, then consider these as narrator....(عن أبيه)
done ---in case we have عن then consider as continued sanad
done ----add روى to the nrc 
done---عبيد الله combined names
done---- صلى الله عليه و عليه السلام should not be detected as a name
done --if we have two nrcs seperated by nothing dont increment the counter (tentative)
done---look into the duplicates in the results of wordsarf (stemmer on_match)
done---صلى الله عليه و عليه السلام should not be detected as a name
done---StemNode and Search_StemNode (jad)
done---string reference in stemmer (jad)
done---all text in stemmer (jad)
done---fix walk (Fadi)
done---fix bug in crashing on deleting of trie if it was loaded from file (maybe due to uninitialized alfa_map) (Jad)
done---index the trie node
done---load and save the trie (tentative)
done---if we have two nrcs seperated by nothing dont increment the counter (tentative)
done ---stress in the full paper that our system is a composition of 3 state machines that reduces the computations done by buckwalter's concatenative analysis that is 3-machines running in sequence. 
done---deserialize (jad)
done---add check if syntax of sql is always acceptable eg: does not contain double quotations since results in """ (jad)
done---add on_match_helper() in stem_search to check if diacritic (1 or even 2) after in the suffix of raw_data are matching
done---check for 2 consequitive diacritics in the following recursive affix in on_match_helper() of tree_search (not totally tested bc no recursive affixes yet)
done---about timestamp and staleness of data of in .dat files
done---solve the bug of diacritics at the end of prefix, stem or suffix eg: بِرد was not working previously
done---solve problem of incompatibe formats of caching structures when using or not using REDUCE_THRU_DIACRITICS
make a loop after suffix is over and delimiter not yet encountered: back to prefix (non-space seperation of words) and make reporting when delimeter is found
consider the ه in أبيه as referring to the on before him so express the relation...
also عنه to be considered
remove names of females or consider them at the end (for later refinements)
numbers should take me to text directly (not necessarily, for later refinements)
biographies
test-senarios from LDC
solve bug in non-diacritic-reduction version (using REDUCE_THRU_DIACRITICS) of code not working
if shadde exists in word force it in possibilities
check for memory leaks in "hadith_general"
build manually recursive affix dictionaries from those of buckwalter
profile code (gprof)
additional refinements
sarf .so
forest of narrations
compare against SAMA
patterns to handle infix
caching structure for new additions to database
find numbers
find time/Date
