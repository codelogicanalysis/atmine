Here are the rules to convert from city, country to nationality, from city or from town or so on

we cannot just added loubnan and have the suffixes added as -iy or -iyan and so on... since saydawey saydaweyan will never be captured and in fact there is no suffix -wey
so it is better to have 2 categories: city-names which are like N-prop and nationality which are like Nall (asma2 el nisba)

To reach this we have to pass our proper nouns into a script that generates from them asma2 el nisba according to some NLP understanding then afterwards we can add the to dictionary

The general rules we came up with are the following:

ends				additional					rule					eg:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
alef 				+consonant before			-wey					sayda --> saydawey		or		7alba --> 7albawey
alef				+waw or ya2 before			-y instead of alef		souriya--> souriyy		or		nikaragwa -->nikaragwiy
consonant or waw								-ya2					lubnan -> lubnaniy		or		hunululo  -->	hunululoy (???)
ta2	marbouta		+consonant before			-ya2 instead of ta2		makka --> makkiy
ya2												-add a shadde on ya2	jibouti --> jiboutiy

Notes:
-remove ta3reef if it is there, except for almanya, albanya, ... 
-asma2 el mourakaba according to last word
