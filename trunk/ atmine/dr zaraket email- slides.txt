Dear Zahraa and Habib,

I appreciate it if you can work on the set of slides for last lecture
about Arabic text rendering and selection problems.


Start with defining the problem. Maybe with a text that spans more than one line.

Start with static text (strings that are all predefined and we only have to show
them --- 4 forms of each character...).

Then move to dynamic text (text entered or received from the net).

Discuss each problem on at least one separate slide. For example: right to left,
bi-directionality,
more text less width, less text more width, wrapping to a new line...



Then move to discuss selection and rendering Arabic selections. Inversion of
selection areas and flikkering on drap...

How to define a good rectangle, what are the alternatives...
Discuss wrap lines and why they are good versus keeping the whole text in lines.
Discuss the issue of copy/paste where we have to copy an Arabic
(or bidirectional string) into another string.
How does that affect rendering and wrapping.









You may want to work on this together to put your memory together.
Or you may want to divide the work,
I prefer the first, but I leave it up to you.

Cheers,
