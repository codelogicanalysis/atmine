  Morphological analysis is key in current automated analysis techniques 
  for Arabic text. 
  Current morphological analyzers take an Arabic word as input and 
  enumerate all possible morphological solutions (stems or 
  derivations) using concatenation based analysis.
  The solutions suffer from accuracy due to the inherent difficulties
  of morphological analysis of the Arabic language. 
  The enumeration of all possible solutions may also hurt the performance
  in cases where not all solutions are needed.
  In this paper, we present a novel efficient morphological analyzer that 
  uses parallel compositional non-deterministic Automata 
  driven by a case based controller.
  The analyzer keeps alive possible analyses of the text 
  for the controller to intervene with a decision and thus 
  reduce false positives on case basis.

  Our concatenative analysis uses recursive affixes in order to
  retain better part of speech information and enhance the 
  efficiency of affix matching. 
  The analyzer takes as input a character from a full text stream 
  rather than a sequence of words and thus performs tokenization
  on the fly and based on morphological correctness. 
  This relieves the user from preprocessing the text and provides
  a more exact tokenization than delimiter based tokenization. 
  This is important for Arabic since two words can occur in a text
  without a delimiter in between.

  We used our analyzer to successfully automate the analysis of 
  three books of Islamic literature where we segmented each book
  into several narrations. In each narration, we detected 
  a chain of narrators, where each narrator is a complex sequence of
  proper names separated with name connector phrases. 
  This is a collection of chain of narrator structures where each
  chain is a structure with three levels of hierarchy.
  Our results show better accuracy and higher efficiency than current 
  morphological analyzers.
