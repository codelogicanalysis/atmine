    abstract = {{Office workers everywhere are drowning in emailâ€”not only spam, but also large quan- 
tities of legitimate email to be read and organized for browsing. Although there have been 
extensive investigations of automatic document categorization, email gives rise to a num- 
ber of unique challenges, and there has been relatively little study of classifying email into 
folders. 
This paper presents an extensive benchmark study of email foldering using two large 
corpora of real-world email messages and foldering schemes: one from former Enron em- 
ployees, another from participants in an SRI research pro ject. We discuss the challenges 
that arise from differences between email foldering and traditional document classification. 
We show experimental results from an array of automated classification methods and eval- 
uation methodologies, including a new evaluation method of foldering results based on the 
email timeline, and including enhancements to the exponential gradient method Winnow, 
providing top-tier accuracy with a fraction the training time of alternative methods. We 
also establish that classification accuracy in many cases is relatively low, confirming the 
challenges of email data, and pointing toward email foldering as an important area for 
further research.}},

	abstractNote={Extracting content from text continues to be an important research problem for information processing and management. Approaches to capture the semantics of text-based document collections may be based on Bayesian models, probability theory, vector space models, statistical models, or even graph theory. As the volume of digitized textual media continues to grow, so does the need for designing robust, scalable indexing and search strategies (software) to meet a variety of user needs. Knowledge extraction or creation from text requires systematic yet reliable processing that can be codified and adapted for changing needs and environments. This book will draw upon experts in both academia and industry to recommend practical approaches to the purification, indexing, and mining of textual information. It will address document identification, clustering and categorizing documents, cleaning text, and visualizing semantic models of text.},

We report observations about languages, named entity types, domains and textual genres studied in the literature. From the start, NERC systems have been developed using hand-made rules, but now machine learning techniques are widely used. These techniques are surveyed along with other critical aspects of NERC such as features and evaluation methods. Features are word-level, dictionary-level and corpus-level representations of words in a document. Evaluation techniques, ranging from intuitive exact match to very complex matching techniques with adjustable cost of errors, are an indisputable key to progress.}},

Over the past half a century, the problem has been addressed from many different perspectives, in varying domains and using various paradigms. This survey intends to investigate some of the most relevant approaches both in the areas of single-document and multipledocument summarization, giving special emphasis to empirical methods and extractive techniques. Some promising approaches that concentrate on specific details of the summarization problem are also discussed. Special attention is devoted to automatic evaluation of summarization systems, as futbaure research on summarization is strongly dependent on progress in this area.},

From a managerial point of view, this integrated framework helps marketing-decision makers to identify customers most prone to switch. Consequently, their customer retention campaigns can be targeted effectively because the prediction method is better at detecting those customers who are likely to leave.},

abstract ={Summary: FACTA is a text search engine for MEDLINE abstracts, which is designed particularly to help users browse biomedical concepts (e.g. genes/proteins, diseases, enzymes and chemical compounds) appearing in the documents retrieved by the query. The concepts are presented to the user in a tabular format and ranked based on the co-occurrence statistics. Unlike existing systems that provide similar functionality, FACTA pre-indexes not only the words but also the concepts mentioned in the documents, which enables the user to issue a flexible query (e.g. free keywords or Boolean combinations of keywords/concepts) and receive the results immediately even when the number of the documents that match the query is very large. The user can also view snippets from MEDLINE to get textual evidence of associations between the query terms and the concepts. The concept IDs and their names/synonyms for building the indexes were collected from several biomedical databases and thesauri, such as UniProt, BioThesaurus, UMLS, KEGG and DrugBank.Availability: The system is available at http://www.nactem.ac.uk/software/facta/Contact: yoshimasa.tsuruoka@manchester.ac.uk},

abstract ={Summary: To allow efficient and systematic retrieval of statements from Medline we have developed EBIMed, a service that combines document retrieval with co-occurrence-based analysis of Medline abstracts. Upon keyword query, EBIMed retrieves the abstracts from EMBL-EBI's installation of Medline and filters for sentences that contain biomedical terminology maintained in public bioinformatics resources. The extracted sentences and terminology are used to generate an overview table on proteins, Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, drugs and species used in the same biological context. All terms in retrieved abstracts and extracted sentences are linked to their entries in biomedical databases. We assessed the quality of the identification of terms and relations in the retrieved sentences. More than 90% of the protein names found indeed represented a protein. According to the analysis of four proteinâ€“protein pairs from the Wnt pathway we estimated that 37% of the statements containing such a pair mentioned a meaningful interaction and clarified the interaction of Dkk with LRP. We conclude that EBIMed improves access to information where proteins and drugs are involved in the same biological process, e.g. statements with GO annotations of proteins, proteinâ€“protein interactions and effects of drugs on proteins.Availability: Available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Rebholz-srv/ebimedSupplementary Data: Supplementary Data are available at Bioinformatics online.Contact:Rebholz@ebi.ac.uk},
