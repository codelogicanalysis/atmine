= Introduction =

BFS traversal of fragmentation tree
  on match we return the position and the resulting category
  we add a function: getMatchDetails that returns a list of pairs (position,category)  to return the details.



  # the stem search should take the resulting category of the prefix
  # the suffix search should take the resulting categories of the prefix and the stem
  # the suffix onMatch should only be called when the suffix covers till the end of the string

   the suffix onMatch should only be called when the suffix covers till the end of the string. this can be implemented as follows. the fragment tree has a function:
{{{
virtual bool shouldCallOnMatch(...) const {
  return true;
};
}}}

  And the suffix subclass should implement this to return true only when the whole length is covered.
{{{
virtual bool shouldCallOnMatch(...) const {
if (whole length is covered) 
  return true; 
return false;
};
}}}

  Then the search operator() should call the shouldCallOnMatch function to check whether to call onMatch or not.
